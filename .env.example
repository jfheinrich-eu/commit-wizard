# Environment Configuration for commit-wizard
#
# Note: This tool uses GitHub Copilot CLI for AI features, which has its own
# authentication system via 'gh auth' and doesn't require environment variables.
#
# The variables below are LEGACY from the old HTTP API approach and are NOT
# currently used by the application. They are kept here for reference only.
#
# If you need to configure logging, you can use standard Rust environment variables:
#   RUST_LOG=debug cargo run        # Enable debug logging
#   RUST_LOG=commit_wizard=trace    # Verbose logging for this crate only
